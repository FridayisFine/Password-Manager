This project was developed using Codio and Spyder IDEs.
Changelog:
August 18, 2025  
Rough draft brought over from Spyder via password_manager_TEMPLATE.py and python3 pw_app.py
Readme is written and added to the project. Template for project has been reviewed multiple times and relevant sources are in order to continue the project from the planning stage to the test stage.
Spyder credit added to README file to show that IDE was used during program creation. (Thank you for recommending that IDE Prof Protas!)
updated instances of 'w' or 'r' to mode = 'w' or mode = 'r' as not using mode throws errors.
August 21, 2025
Major debugging completed. Formatting issues from copying over from Spyder corrected.
Loops & if/else statements added to handle bad entries and redirect user to the menu tree instead of crashing.
Invalid characters continue to be an issue. List returned to empty state to prevent errors.
An unexpected loop hole that allowed logging in with bad passwords has been fixed.
Lots of \n's were added to improve legibility for print functions.
